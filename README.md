### Vehicle Document Tracking Backend System

**Repository:** [https://github.com/ManishBadgotra/vehicle-details](https://github.com/ManishBadgotra/vehicle-details)

* Integrated third‑party API to retrieve real‑time vehicle information.
* Implemented a scheduled goroutine process that fetches updated data weekly based on client requirements.
